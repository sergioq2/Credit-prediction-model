Credit model prediction
Author: Sergio Quintero
Language: Python
This repository contains the development of a Credit card acceptance prediction model using Python. The project's goal is to analyze and model the probability of Credit card acceptance

Files
modelado.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook that contains all the development of the exploratory, descriptive, and modeling analysis of credit risk.

Deployment: This folder contains the files used to create the application or implement the risk model in a production environment.

About the Model
Exploratory data analysis and Credit card acceptance modeling were performed using Machine Learning techniques, specifically leveraging popular Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. Various variables were explored, and classification algorithms were applied to predict the probability of a customer's default.

For more details about the model development, please refer to the modelado.ipynb file.

Model Application
The files in the Deployment folder are used to implement the Credit card acceptance prediction model in a production environment. These files may include scripts, configurations, or any other elements necessary to execute the application on a server or platform.
